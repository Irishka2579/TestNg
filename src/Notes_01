What is testNG?
-is a tool we use to automate applications.

Why we need testNG if we have selenium?
-reports
-parallel execution
-grouping
-data driven testing
-multiple options for execution

@Test annotation- this is the main annotation of testing to execute our TC

it executes test cases in alphabetical order by default

@before method as a precondition that executes before every TC
@after method  as a precondition that executes after every TC

Assertions:
Hard assertions--we use for small execution bc its stops execution if encounters error
Soft assertions-- we use to execute complete
to get the collective failure of test case

mac users - option+cmd+L

Testing.xml where highest level is suite -->test-->packages-->class-->methods(@Test)
groups-we use different groups to separate the test cases

alwaysrun = true - we use this attribute to execute the pre and post condition from testng.xml file
